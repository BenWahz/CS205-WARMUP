# CS205-WARMUP
Warm-up Project for CS 205.

## Database creation
A large part of how we built our database was using the link below. It was modified to fit our CSVs and a foreign key constraint was added

To run the database creation code:
1. Make sure your directory does not contain pizzaCities.db
2. Uncomment line 21 "createTables()" 
3. Comment out line 25 "search()"
4. Run the program
5. Undo steps 2 and 3

## Foreign key query
The foreign key consraint between our two tables is the city column in both tables. The query that implements a join is the following:
"city price $/$$/$$$"

## Instructions
When running the program, an ascii menu will appear with detailed instructions on the syntax of queries as well as giving example queries to run.
